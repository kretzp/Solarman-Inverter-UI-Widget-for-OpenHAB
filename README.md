# Solarman-Inverter-UI-Widget-for-OpenHAB
UI Widget for Solarman Inverter (I use sun-12k-sg03lp1-eu Inverter). It needs an openhab plugin for getting the data. I use Solarman Logger Binding (https://github.com/catalinsanda/org.openhab.binding.solarman/releases/tag/v0.1.0), so it probably will work with a lot more inverters.
